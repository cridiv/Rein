# Rein - AI Resolution Coach with Self-Improving Intelligence

> **"Most AI resolution apps give the same generic advice to everyone. Rein learns what actually works for YOU and adapts its coaching in real-time."**

## 🎯 Project Overview

Rein is an AI-powered resolution execution platform that transforms New Year's resolutions into actionable plans, syncs them to real productivity tools, and uses advanced evaluation techniques to continuously improve its coaching quality.

Unlike traditional AI planners that stop at generating advice, Rein:

- ✅ Turns vague resolutions into SMART, actionable goals
- ✅ Generates personalized week-by-week execution plans
- ✅ Syncs tasks directly to Google Calendar
- ✅ Provides intelligent check-ins with adaptive coaching
- ✅ **Uses Opik to systematically evaluate and improve AI quality**
- ✅ Tracks progress through streaks and completion metrics

├── Empathy/Tone (1-10): Motivating vs. demotivating language
└── Safety Score (1-10): Free of pushy/harmful suggestions
```

**2. Agent Optimization Loop**

- Baseline prompt performance measured in Week 1-2
- Opik Agent Optimizer runs automated prompt tuning
- A/B testing different coaching strategies
- **Target**: 40%+ improvement in quality scores by Week 4

**3. Experiment Tracking**

```

## 📊 Key Metrics & Evaluation

### Success Metrics

**User Engagement**

- Streak length (days)
- Check-in completion rate (%)
- Task completion rate (aggregate across platforms)
- Platform usage distribution (Calendar vs GitHub vs Jira)
- Preferred check-in channel (in-app vs Slack vs Email)
- Time to first multi-platform sync (minutes)

**AI Quality (via Opik)**

- Goal Clarity Score: Target 8.5/10
- Task Actionability: Target 9.0/10
- Personalization: Target 7.5/10
- Empathy/Tone: Target 8.0/10
- Safety Score: Target 9.5/10
- **Platform Routing Accuracy: Target 92%+**

**System Performance**

- Average response time: < 2 seconds
- Gemini API error rate: < 1%
- Calendar sync success rate: > 95%
- **GitHub sync success rate: > 90%**
- **Jira sync success rate: > 90%**
- **Slack notification delivery: > 98%**
- **Email delivery rate: > 95%**

### Evaluation Dataset

We created 30 diverse test resolutions covering:

- Career advancement (6) - mix of technical and non-technical
- Health & fitness (6) - coding-focused developers
- Learning & skills (6) - programming languages, frameworks
- Personal relationships (4)
- Financial goals (4)
- Side projects/entrepreneurship (4)

Each resolution is evaluated across:

- All quality dimensions (clarity, actionability, etc.)
- **Platform routing decisions** (is GitHub/Jira/Calendar appropriate?)
- Multi-platform scenarios (resolutions requiring 2+ platforms)

**Example Test Cases**:

1. "Learn React and build 3 projects" → Expected: GitHub issues + Calendar events
2. "Ship MVP for my SaaS idea" → Expected: Jira sprint + GitHub + Calendar
3. "Run a marathon by June" → Expected: Calendar only
4. "Get promoted to senior engineer" → Expected: Jira goals + Calendar events + GitHub contributions
